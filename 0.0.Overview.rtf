Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications using container based Virtualization technique.\
\
Docker Engine\
Its a client-server application with these major components.\
\
A Server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process.\
\
A REST API which specifies interfaces that program can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.\
\
Docker Hub - Repository of images just like Maven is repository of libraries\
\
JDK 1.8, Tomcat 8(On 8080), JDK 1.7 Tomcat 7(On 8080)\
Docker\
Host OS\
Server\
\
Docker sits on top of Host OS. We can run multiple containers on Docker.\
\
Docker for DEVOPS is like MAVEN for Java\
\
What is Docker platform ?\
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. This isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host.\
\
Summary\
Simple and Easily Configurable\
Easy to Develop on\
Faster release cycles\
Faster deployment times\
Reduced bloat as compared to other virtualisation techniques\
Consistent development of software across all environments}
